/*
Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).

Series:

1 
+
1/4
+
1/7
+
1/10
+
1/13
+
1/16
+
â€¦ 

You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.
